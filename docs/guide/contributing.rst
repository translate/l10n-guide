We welcome contributions -- if you are a localiser then this is your document.
Please think of this as a living document.  If you are using part of it and
find that it is out of date then please update it so that others don't have to
go through your pain.

If you have a new section to contribute or some corrections then please create
an account and make changes.  If you feel it might be controvercial then please
email translate-devel@lists.sourceforge.net. If you have some criticism
we also welcome it but if you accompany it with the changes then you are more
likely to be listened to (its easy to complain, a little harder to contribute
meaningfully)

We :doc:`credit <credits>` those who contribute whole sections and
significatant update.
