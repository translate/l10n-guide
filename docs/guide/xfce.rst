XFCE Translation
****************

XFCE is a lightweight desktop environment and is therfore much faster then the
more feature rich :doc:`KDE <kde_desktop>` and :doc:`Gnome <gnome_desktop>`
desktops.

What first?
===========

XFCE4 contains approximately 3500 words so targeting is not that much of an
issue with XFCE itself.  However, XFCE makes use of GTK therefore to appear
fully translated you will have to translate some of those packages and a
narrowed focus in that area would be useful.

FIXME: create a targetted list based on standard XFCE with no external
applications.
