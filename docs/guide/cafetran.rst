Cafetran CAT tool
*****************

Cafetran is a CAT tool with translation memory, glossary lookup, and web
searching.  It also supports sourceless translation using an autocomplete
function.

Cafetran is written in Java.  Cafetran is not free, but a time-limited trial
version can be downloaded from its web site.

What makes Cafetran interesting is that it uses XLIFF for its native TM format.
Documents translated in Cafetran automatically generate an XLIFF file as you go
along.

Cafetran is fairly complicated to use, and the menu bar is very non-standard.
The help file contained on the web site is not very comprehensive or well
organised.
