Translating Google
******************

NOTE: It seems that as at 13 Oct 2004 Google says that they "cannot support more

While not Open Source or Free Software the Google search engine is a powerful
tool used by many on the Internet.  Google can be localised for you language
using their own custom interface.

translation will look like in real life.  That is an advantage of a web based applications.
