Translating Google
******************

NOTE: It seems that as at 13 Oct 2004 Google says that they "cannot support
more languages at this time".  So I'm afraid your language will probably not be
supported.

While not Open Source or Free Software the Google search engine is a powerful
tool used by many on the Internet.  Google can be localised for you language
using their own custom interface.

How to translate
================

The process is simple, `register
<https://translate.google.com/community?source=t-new-user>`_ and then follow the on screen
instructions.  One advantage of translating Google is that you can quicly see
what your translation will look like in real life.  That is an advantage of a
web based applications.
