Online Translation Tools
************************

There are a number of online translation tools that you might want to use to
assist your translation projects.  Being online they allow you to work from
anywhere, it also allows many people to participate without having to install
software or configure a PO editing tool.

As the developers of `Pootle <http://pootle.translatehouse.org>`_ we are happy
to see that the idea of online translation has become more popular since we
originally gave Pootle to the world.
