There are a few approaches you can follow to make untranslated program names accesible
to non-English speakers.

Pros and Cons of Translating Program Names
==========================================

^ Pros  | The program is shown is a script/pronunciation that the user understands  |
^ Cons  | A user will not find the translated program anywhere on the system.  Ie they will not be able to run the program using its translated name  |

Some tips
=========

  * **Use single quotes**. It is quite easy to use single quotes around the program to indicate that it has not been translated e.g. "Click on the 'KFishMonger' icon"
  * **Change sentence structure**. This source string "%s: Can't init pipe to gdmgreeter" can quite easily be translated as "%s: Can't init pipe to program gdmgreeter", note that by adding the word program it adds clarity
  * **Use explanatory brackets**. If needed add explanatory brackets after the word.  You have two options just stick to one method throughout:
    - Translated_Program (English_Original)
    - English_Original (Translate/Transliteration).
