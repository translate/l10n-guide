Program syntax and Spreadsheet functions
****************************************

Often you will find examples of program languages (syntax) or spreadsheet
functions in your translations.

Simple Policy
=============

Need a simple policy on what to translate?

**Never translate function names, spreadsheet functions or program syntax**

.. _../pages/guide/translation/program_syntax#what_does_this_look_like:

What does this look like?
=========================

* Functions: not(), getLastAuthor(), sheet.Count()
* Spreadsheet Functions: SUM, AVERAGE, DDIST
* Syntax: FIXME examples? NULL
* SQL: INSERT, SELECT, WHERE, NOT

.. _../pages/guide/translation/program_syntax#why_to_translate_or_no_translate:

Why to translate or no translate
================================

Program languages are in themselves their own language.  So think of it as
another language that is untranslatable.  For instance when programming in Java
using a Chinese programming tool you will still write in the English looking
Java language.

The same applies to spreadsheets.  However, in some countries they have had
versions of software that are in deed translated.  So the common functions,
SUM, COUNT, etc are translated.  It is probably best that you do not translate
them unless they are in common usage.  Remember that when someone uses your
software in their languages and want to type SUM to add a column of figures and
you have translate this, then they will need to knwo the translated function
name. Could be very problematic if they already now the English version.  So
think of Spreadsheet functions as they same as a programming language.
