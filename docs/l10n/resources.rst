Language-specific resources

Vietnamese — Tiếng Việt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `The most common Net acronyms in Vietnamese
  <http://www.riverland.net.au/~clytie/viet/netacrvn.html>`_ lists many online,
  technical or chat abbreviations in both English and Vietnamese.
* `Lac Việt English-Vietnamese dictionaries
  <http://www.lacviet.com.vn/webmtd/webmtd.aspx>`_, including their computing
  dictionary, which is probably the most current computing dictionary available
  online, although the whole dictionary site is often unavailable
* `KSVN English-Vietnamese, Vietnamese-English dictionaries
  <http://www.ksvn.com/anhviet_new.htm>`_ which seem to have some words and
  phrases you don't find elsewhere: their databases are definitely more current
  than some
* `The Free Vietnamese Dictionary Project
  <http://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~duc/Dict/index.html>`_ has a really
  impressive array of Vietnamese dictionaries to and from various languages,
  and is constantly improving it. This is probably the most thorough and
  reliable database of Vietnamese dictionaries. They are also available to run
  offline, on desktop/laptop computers or PDA.
* `The English-Vietnamese Glossary Service <http://vnoss.net/evgs/>`_ is an
  excellent initiative, though currently hampered by lack of volunteer time. It
  should develop into an authoritative resource.

.. _../pages/l10n/resources#dutch_—_nederlands:

Dutch — Nederlands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* `English-Dutch dictionary of the Dutch Translation Project team
  <http://vertaling.vrijschrift.nl/woordenboek>`_ contains English to Dutch
  translations of common terms in open-source software that the translators'
  community has agreed upon. Their section for translators also contains links
  to other useful resources.
